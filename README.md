This is an example program for integrating Dear ImGui and GLFW into Source Engine's app system, which is the same thing Source's tools use.

Feel free to do with this as you please, and if you make something cool or have a complaint send it to me via an issue on this repo or any other platform.

If you have issues compiling Dear ImGui with Visual Studio 2013, [I would suggest trying out Visual Studio 2022 using my other repo.](https://github.com/ozxybox/source-mp13-vs2022)
